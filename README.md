<br />
<br />
<h2>Determine SLA Plan:</h2>  <br/>
  Upon first glace, the client initally states the entire department is unable to access the program. After calling the client, it is determined that only a couple of people are affected. This tells us that the issue is not a high priority and that we can set the SLA accordingly.
<br />
  <br /> 
  In order to change these, we will click on the blue link next to both 'Priority' and 'SLA Plan'

<br />
<br />
<h2>Update to correct SLA:</h2> <br/>
  Here we see the menu that opens after clicking the link by 'SLA-Plan'. We click the drop-down box and changed the SLA to 'Sev-C' and add a small description for why.

<br />
<br />
  <h2>Update to correct Priority:</h2> <br/>
  We do the same thing as with the SLA, instead changing the priority from 'High' to 'Low' since the issue is not as critical to the bussiness.

<br />
<br />
<h2>Provide updates on progress:</h2>  <br/>
  Once the SLA and priorties are set correctly, we will reach out to the clients with any updates and solutions we may come up with.

  A drop-down menu will appear allowing us to switch the status from 'Open' to 'Resolved'. We click 'Resolved' and another menu will appear.
